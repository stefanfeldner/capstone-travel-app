# Travel Planner Application

This app combines all the knowledge gained from my learning experience at Udacity.
It's a travel and weather application, combining the data from 3 different APIs to show the weather forecast, an image of the destination; and the geolocation.
All of it is running asynchronously and with webpack and service workers installed.
